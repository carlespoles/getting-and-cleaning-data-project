# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


## Instructions

This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.
* You need to specify your R working directory.
* The R script will download the required input files from the specified repository. (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
* The R script will unzip the files in a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset".
* We will need to create a folder called "output" under the same R working directory to store the output files from the script. This is the only manual step for a given user (ensure the folder is created/exists).
* Load and run the script "run_analysis.R" in RStudio. 
* Three output files will be created: mean_and_std.csv, tidy_dataset.csv and tidy_dataset.txt.
* I have included the three output files in this repository: "getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project/output/".
